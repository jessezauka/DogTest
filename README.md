# DoggyLand - Dog walking services

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This responsive, user friendly website can serve as a profile for a dog walker. It features Areas where
the dog walker works, Pricing and testimonials of his previous clients. There is an enquiry page as
well that lets clients enquire about times available, pricing or book the service. This website provides
a great way for a dog walker to find his future clients and stay relevant and in business for a long
time.

## UX

The user experience of this website is aimed at the client of the dog walking services. The main aim
is to serve 3 types of visitors to the website:

A newbie researcher – this is a visitor who is window shopping, looking around and checking the
possible pricing. Such visitor primarily wants to see two things: pricing and location. The website
provides both in a very convenient way – menu has both pricing and areas covered. Both can be
accessed either by clicking on the menu or by scrolling down the page.

Prospect – a visitor who sees that both – the pricing and the locations available are suitable and who
is almost ready to make the decision. To help in decision making process this website has client
testimonials easily accessible and so providing a great user experience for Prospects. The
testimonials can be accessed by clicking on a menu or by scrolling down the page. A prospect can
conveniently flick through the testimonials by using right and left arrows. It is a very User friendly
feature because not all prospects may want to see all existing testimonials. Some may be happy with
only two or three of them. Having testimonials as a separate section with arrows right and left lets
them decide how many testimonials is enough.

Finally, a lead is the visitor who has seen the locations, pricing and testimonials helped him to decide
and pick the service. Such visitors will conveniently find the enquiry form if they scroll down to the
very end of the website or simply click on menu. Every part of the pricing table also has the link to
make an enquiry which is very convenient for the user if he is in a hurry.
The website is designed with he above three types of visitors in mind, to create a sales pipline and
convert visitors into quality customers.

## Features:

I have followed the minimal viable product design strategy. I tried to reduce any features to bare
minimum in order to serve the main goal of the website: convert visitors into quality leads and then
into paying customers.

There are 4 main features that I think are essential for this process:

1) Areas covered are conveniently presented on an interactive map. Nowadays everyone is
used to google maps and therefore I chose the google map API to help represent areas
covered in an easy to understand way.

2) Pricing table is another very important feature. The pricing table has a link to make an
enquiry right away.

3) Testimonials is the third feature providing great user experience. The testimonials may be
checked by clicking right and left arrows. It’s a very handy way to display them because
some visitors may find it perfectly enough to see one or two testimonials before making
decision.

4) The fourth and the main feature is the enquiry form. A lead can conveniently fill out the
form and submit it and request the call back from the owner.
Features left to implement.

There could be many things done to increase lead conversion rate. One of them would be a to
introduce an e-commerce feature that allows visitors to instantly book the first appointment. That
feature should include a calendar, a booking form and a payment system.

##Technologies used

I used Html 5, CSS 3 and Bootstrap (4.3.1) for putting the website together.

## Testing

I did some testing on several areas.

1. Responsiveness of the website:
1.1. I reduced the screen size by dragging it on my laptop to half and then to quarter.
1.2. I then checked how the website looks like on my PC which has 20inch screen size
1.3. Then I loaded the website on my mobile phone (Samsung galaxy s7) and then on my
friend’s iPhone.
1.4. I loaded the website on the Samsung tablet and on the iPad. All tests were successful

2. Autofill of the enquiry form:
2.1. I tried filling in my details in the enquiry form and checking to make sure the autofill
works.
2.2. I submitted the form and was thrown into 405 Not Allowed page which is acceptable as
this is just a front end project.

3. Checking the menu
3.1. I tried clicking into all sections of the menu to make sure that it brings me to the correct
place on the website. The test was successful.

4. Checking the map
4.1. I tried scrolling forward and backward to make sure the area increases or decreases in
size as required. The test was successful.

5. Links – I clicked all links on the website making sure the all work as intended. The test was
successful.

## Deployment
The deployment cannot be performed if the backend is not in place. I would consider writing
the backend code using any of the backend languages – PHP, Node.js or Python.
